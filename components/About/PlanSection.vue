        KIT’s Strategic Plan 2020-25 comprises six core areas: (1) educational
        programs, (2) research & innovation, (3) faculty and staff development,
        (4) the promotion of industry-university linkages, (5)
        internationalization and (6) building of a smart and green campus.

      <div class="py-3">
        These six areas were selected and discussed during a half-day
        consultation workshop held at KIT on December 14, 2019. Participants
        were representatives from a range of stakeholders, including KIT’s
        Governing Board members, senior management team, students, alumni,
        faculty members and staff and experts from other institutions, including
        partner higher education institutions and the private sector. Their
        varied perspectives and rich experiences added valuable input into the
        discussion and planning. The Governing Board meeting on December 15,
        2019 provided further advice and suggestions to the development of the
        Strategic Plan. Such an inclusive engagement approach ensures the
        relevance and public ownership of KIT’s programs.
